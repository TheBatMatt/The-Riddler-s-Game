            <h1>The Bat Quiz</h1>
        
            <p>You are Robin. The <span>Riddler</span> has captured you and is forcing you to take a timed quiz about the Dark Knight himself! It's a cruel game that he has claimed to have played with several Gotham inhabitants already. If you answer all of his questions correctly, a Bat signal will be shined in the sky telling Batman there is trouble, and the <span>Riddler</span> has agreed to turn himself in. The alternative is less than ideal. Can you claim victory in the <span>Riddler's</span> game? Or will <span>Riddler</span> and his massive ego have the night? </p>
