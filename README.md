## The Riddler's Game

You are Robin. The <span>Riddler</span> has captured you and is forcing you to take a timed quiz about the Dark Knight himself! It's a cruel game that he has claimed to have played with several Gotham inhabitants already. If you answer all of his questions correctly, a Bat signal will be shined in the sky telling Batman there is trouble, and the Riddler has agreed to turn himself in. The alternative is less than ideal. Can you claim victory in the <span>Riddler's</span> game? Or will <span>Riddler</span> and his massive ego have the night?

The quiz consists of 15 Batman related questions. A maximum of 15 points, with each corrected answer being equal to one point. If you don't beat the clock, the Riddler wins!
